Summary of Classes/ Hiearchy:

Constants - Contains constants, variables and links the hardware as manipulable additions to the code

Robot- The class that controls all aspects of the robot/ ties all of the classes together

    OpModes- Run on the FTC Driver Stations and FTC Robot Controllers. They are the Code actually
    affect the hardware

        Opmode- The FIRST Opmode that allows for basic connections between Hardware and Software

            TeleOP Modes- Opmodes that allow for driver control of the robots


                MainTeleOpMode- Allows for driver control of the robot


            Autonomous- Opmodes that control the robot for the Autonomous portion of the competition

                Craterside- An Autonomous Opmode intended to be used on the crater side of the field

                Depotside- An Autonomous Opmode intended to be used on the depot side of the field

                DetectionOutsourcing- An Autonomous Opmode given by a fellow Tigard High School team
                that has Vuforia properly integrated into it. It's to be used as an example for integrating
                Vuforia into our own code

                TestAuto- A test Autonomous Opmode

                TestAuto2- A Test Autonomous Opmode

    Classes Related to Hardware:
        Encoder- Counts rotations of hte motor and turns them into useful units
        Motor- Allows for a link between hardware and software for MOTORS
        Servo- Allows for a link between hardware and software for SERVOS
        CRServo- Allows for a link between hardware and software for CRServos
